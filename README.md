## Please folks!
This contains shell scripts. I use them when setting up my system and testing, but please, please! always check what you download.
Better safe than malware 

### gittris
Lutris related shell script to download and install (or update) Git versions of Lutris and umu-launcher (for Proton support)

### fixlutrisvice
Lutris related shell script to link in a newer build of VICE as Lutris's stock VICE is pretty old
